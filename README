Solana Token Manager is a repository for managing the SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens that I have issued.
It includes:
	•	Detailed information about the tokens (name, symbol, decimals, supply, etc.)
	•	Standardized metadata JSON files for updating or registering tokens on platforms like Solscan, SolanaFM, and various wallets
	•	Deployment guides, metadata updates, and token management using tools such as Metaboss and Solana CLI
	•	Scripts to automate metadata updates, token distribution, and mint authority management
